# 🎢 DSA Team Portfolio

A Flask web app where we showcase our data structures projects. The main feature is an interactive queue system that handles customers with priority levels—basically learning DSA by building something practical.

## 📖 What is this?

We built this as a school project to learn about **queues**, **linked lists**, and **web development** at the same time. The app has:

- A **custom queue implementation** (doubly-ended) that we wrote from scratch
- A **live demo page** where you can add customers, mark them as priority, and serve them in order
- A **team page** so everyone knows who to contact

Basically: learn DSA + build a real web app = this project.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python + Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 templates
- **Data**: JSON files (team info, project list)
- **Custom Data Structures**: Our own queue and node classes
